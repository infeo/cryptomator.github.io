          <h2>Cryptomator for Android for Us Paranoids</h2>
          <p>This blog post is aimed towards the paranoid Cryptomator power users among us and describes how to fully establish a relationship of trust with Cryptomator for Android.</p>
<p>When it comes to our desktop application, we claim that you should in fact <em>not</em> trust us but you (or at least many developers) can instead <em>inspect</em> what Cryptomator is doing. For our mobile apps, this is only half the truth, frankly. While the encryption code is fully open-source, the UI and cloud access code isn&rsquo;t (yet üòâ).<br>
If you count yourself as one of the more paranoid users, who prefer to compile everything yourselves, you might ask the legitimate question: How can you check the current, open-core app for backdoors?</p>
<p>A backdoor usually requires communication with an external server. If vaults are only opened from the device&rsquo;s file system, the Cryptomator app does not require an internet connection. Alternatively, the vault can be synchronized bidirectionally to the file system of the smartphone with a third-party application such as <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syncthing</a>.</p>
<p>Using this setup, the Cryptomator app can have its internet access revoked using the Android operating system features, which prevents the app from sending or receiving any data to or from the internet.</p>
<figure class="text-center">
  <img class="inline-block rounded" src="/img/blog/android-for-paranoids-permission.png" alt="Android revoke Cryptomator's internet permission" />
</figure>
<p>Thus, even if there ever was a backdoor in Cryptomator for Android, it would not be possible for the intercepted data to leave the smartphone. This is ensured by the operating system.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator 1.5.0 Release</h2>
          <figure class="text-center">
  <img class="inline-block rounded" src="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png" srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.5.0 is now available with a brand-new user interface (incl. dark mode) and an improved vault format" />
</figure>
<p>Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.</p>
<p>To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider <a href="/donate/">buying a donation key</a>, which unlocks the new dark mode. ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detailed release notes</a> for the desktop app are available on GitHub.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. ‚ú®</p>
<h2 id="cryptomator-for-ios--android">Cryptomator for iOS &amp; Android</h2>
<p>New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well. To celebrate the release, our mobile apps are 40% off until April 23! ü§ñ</p>
<p>Cryptomator for Android is now also available as an APK version <a href="/android/">through our own online store</a>.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2020</h2>
          <p>Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-our-desktop-application">State of our Desktop Application</h2>
<p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p>
<p>While we have already discussed <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes</a> to what we call the <em>vault format</em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:</p>
<p>We did not simply <em>redesign</em> our UI, we did a full <em>rewrite</em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.</p>
<p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-android-app">State of the Android App</h2>
<p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.</li>
<li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn‚Äôt work</li>
<li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background</li>
<li>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-of-the-ios-app">State of the iOS App</h2>
<p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. üòâ</p>
<h2 id="what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150">What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?</h2>
<p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986">this one</a>), we&rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations</a> added by our great community on a regular basis.</p>
<h2 id="whats-up-next">What&rsquo;s up next?</h2>
<p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.</p>
<p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729">we didn&rsquo;t get Cryptomator working</a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.</p>
<p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</h2>
          <p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.</p>
<h2 id="desktop">Desktop</h2>
<p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&rdquo; feature.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save password in system (Linux):</strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. üòÑ The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!</li>
<li><strong>Custom Mount Flags:</strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: <em>Use at your own risk!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. üòâ</p>
<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>
<p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.</p>
<p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Provider</a> which is going to be extended by the methods &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Move&rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.</p>
<h2 id="android">Android</h2>
<p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic photo upload:</strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.</li>
<li><strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:</strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are considering these features for future versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LRU Cache:</strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Google Team Drives:</strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:</strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.</li>
<li><strong>Unlocking with system password:</strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)</li>
<li><strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:</strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Upload of directories (recursive):</strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount <code>cryptomator-vault</code> which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code> (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved macOS Sierra integration, unlocking doesn&rsquo;t ask for username/password for <code>localhost</code> anymore (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#170</a>)</li>
<li>Improved iCloud Drive compatibility (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#364</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on some systems</li>
<li>Added <code>CMD+,</code> shortcut for preferences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed license to GPLv3</li>
<li>Dropped SHA-1 signatures in Windows Authenticode code signing</li>
<li>Dropped official Windows Vista support</li>
<li>Dropped official Ubuntu Vivid and Wily support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-details-on-windows-mounting">Technical Details on Windows Mounting</h3>
<p>After we have fixed <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#431</a>, we noticed various issues on Windows. We tried hosting the virtual drive via <code>localhost</code>, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>::1</code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn&rsquo;t properly work (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512</a>). That&rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host <code>cryptomator-vault</code> (which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code>) into the <code>hosts</code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don&rsquo;t quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!</p>
<h3 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-The-Hood Improvements</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator for Android 0.1 Beta</h2>
          <p>We&rsquo;ve finally released the first beta version of Cryptomator for Android after almost 6 months of development. It&rsquo;s a completely new and native app. In this process, we outsourced the cryptographic code from our main project, which is now available as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoLib</a>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to test the beta version. Follow <a href="/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> for more information. Version 0.1 is by far not feature-complete and has known issues, but we&rsquo;re of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>
<p>You can send us feedback on <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. We&rsquo;ve created a repository just for collecting Android issues. Please review and follow our <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your patience! We know some of you have been already waiting for an Android app of Cryptomator for many months. We&rsquo;re looking forward to your feedback! üòÑ</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 0.2: We&rsquo;re going to fix some critical/major bugs first, don&rsquo;t expect too many new features.</li>
<li>After that we&rsquo;ll most likely successively add support for Google Drive, OneDrive, and WebDAV.</li>
<li>Our goal is to add the functionality equal to the iOS app for the final version.</li>
</ul>
