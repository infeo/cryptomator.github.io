        <title>Update on the Document Provider Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, we need to adjust our schedule for certain features. We are well aware that the Document Provider is the most-requested feature of the Android app, but despite this fact, we need to temporarily shift our attention to other tasks within this project. This blog post you&amp;rsquo;re reading right now is to keep you, our community, updated and inform you that we are unable to stick to our original plan. Unfortunately, this means that any further development of the Document Provider feature needs to be postponed to the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-document-provider-feature&#34;&gt;The Document Provider Feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As users of our Android app, you know how cumbersome sometimes the work with it is: You open your favourite notes app to quickly jot something down, then notice that you cannot open your to-do list from the app because you store it encrypted with Cryptomator. So you sigh, open the Cryptomator app, unlock your vault, navigate to the to-do list file and open it with the aforementioned notes app. Definitely not the optimal workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always strive to provide the same features across all our supported platforms. One of these is a user-friendly integration of the vault into the running OS to easily access content of unlocked vaults. For the desktop systems, this feature was always present and recently we added it in our new iOS app. The last OS, where it is missing is Android. And the way to resolve this, is implementing a Document Provider for our Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Document Provider feature creates a virtual access point to an unlocked vault, with the consequence that you can conveniently browse and access a vault‚Äôs content via the standard file browser. Also, any app which supports browsing through Document Providers can directly load files from your unlocked vault without the need to go via Cryptomator‚Äôs app GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-status&#34;&gt;Development Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development is tracked in the following ticket of our issue tracker: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the issue is already quite old and got over the time a countable amount of comments. After &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/blog/2020/12/23/android-open-source/&#34;&gt;publishing the source code&lt;/a&gt; of the app at the end of 2020, our plan was to work on this important feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the technical side, we already determined the parts of code needed to be edited, developed a concept and built a proof of concept (see the linked ticket). The next step would be to actually implement it including rigorous testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we determined that integrating Document Provider into the existing app would require major architectural changes, therefore requiring a lot of time and resources. We have exciting plans with Cryptomator after our next major release with version 1.6.0 so that we have to delay the development of the Document Provider integration to the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, maybe you, our community can help us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;call-for-contributions&#34;&gt;Call for Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptomator for Desktop was always open source. Cryptomator for iOS and Android are now open source as well. And as such, we also rely on our community to receive feedback, distribute the app and improve its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we are always very excited about contributions and are happy to assist, especially when it comes to the Document Provider. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS: Open Source and Beta Release</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, the time has come! üéâ The brand new iOS app of Cryptomator can now be tried out in a beta version via TestFlight and the project is now, as previously announced, fully open-source! This means that the entire Cryptomator family is now open-source, consisting of the Desktop, Android, and iOS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS on TestFlight: &lt;a href=&#34;https://testflight.apple.com/join/WMtYSrzD&#34;&gt;https://testflight.apple.com/join/WMtYSrzD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-source repository on GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/ios&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptomator/ios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;inline-block rounded&#34; src=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/ios-2.0-beta.png&#34; srcset=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/ios-2.0-beta.png 1x, https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/ios-2.0-beta@2x.png 2x&#34; alt=&#34;Cryptomator 2.0 for iOS: Open Source and Beta Release&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Cryptomator app with full integration into the Files app of iOS fulfills one of the biggest feature requests. For example, it is now possible to save encrypted files directly into a Cryptomator vault within Word. On iPad, drag &amp;amp; drop is possible with the new app. In general, all features of the Files app are automatically supported by Cryptomator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development on the new iOS app started just over a year ago and was rewritten from scratch in the Swift programming language. We are now using the latest tools to develop the app and can therefore support new features of iOS faster. This makes the project more future-proof and easier to maintain. Half a year ago, we were able to open-source the Android app and have released numerous updates with great contributions from the community since then. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to release the source code of the new iOS app as well. Through open-source, the new app is now accessible to all interested developers and the whole community, as we are used to from our other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to your feedback and contributions and are very grateful to you and the whole community that made this step possible. To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/donate/&#34;&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/&#34;&gt;sponsoring&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Strategic Autonomy in Danger: European Tech Companies Warn Of Lowering Data Protection Levels in the EU</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;Joint statement from IT companies Boxcryptor, Cryptomator, Mailbox.org, Mail.de, Mailfence, Praxonomy, Tresorit, and Tutanota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the initiative &amp;ldquo;Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content&amp;rdquo;, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy. The initiative would also severely harm Europe‚Äôs strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe as a global technology leader is respected internationally for its high level of data protection, notably due to the exemplary effect of the GDPR. In an internationally very competitive market, European companies are in first position when it comes to data protection. The EU initiative could now endanger this unique selling point of European IT companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons we request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high level of data protection in the European Union must be maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental rights must be preserved, especially the right to privacy and digital privacy of correspondence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call for mass surveillance is too simplistic and short-thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-level-of-data-protection-in-the-eu-must-be-maintained&#34;&gt;High level of data protection in the EU must be maintained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation is a global model for the protection of personal data. Some countries have already launched or enacted their own versions of the GDPR. The European Union now planning exactly the opposite steps is a wrong signal with fatal effects for the EU as an IT location. High data protection standards lead to great trust in European IT products. The &amp;ldquo;Made in Europe&amp;rdquo; label weighs heavily in our customers‚Äô ‚Äì not only in Europe, but  worldwide. The compulsion to break the high protection of end-to-end encrypted communication endangers the business of numerous IT companies throughout the EU. It would destroy an important unique selling point for European IT companies on the global market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We explicitly emphasize that access to encrypted communication by private organizations and public authorities is incompatible with a strong EU as a technology location.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;right-to-privacy-and-the-digital-secrecy-of-correspondence&#34;&gt;Right to privacy and the digital secrecy of correspondence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected communication is essential for coexistence within our society. The doctor&amp;rsquo;s duty of confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege, for example, are considered immeasurably valuable rights. But how are these professions supposed to maintain their professional secrecy if protected communication with patients and clients is not possible? Like most modern industries they rely on secure, digital communication to keep their vows of confidentiality. The monitoring of all communication within number-independent services equals a technological setback to the 20th century. Postal and personal communication would be left the only secure alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the EU initiative will not stop crimes from being committed. It will also not stop criminal individuals to set up private, end-to-end encrypted chat services for illegal activities with little effort and thus continue to elude law enforcement authorities. It is the majority of private individuals, relying on public networks with many participants, who will be truly affected by the EU initiative ‚Äì and who will be deprived of their right to confidential communication in digital spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The protection of digital privacy of correspondence must not be weakened. To the contrary, with the steady shift of sensitive communication in all areas of our society to the digital sphere, strong end-to-end encryption is imperative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;call-for-mass-surveillance-is-too-simplistic-and-short-thought&#34;&gt;Call for mass surveillance is too simplistic and short-thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to call on the European Commission to refrain from populist, actionist politics and to solve problems on the substantive level. To effectively ban secure communications for all EU citizens makes life unsafe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abolition of privacy is particularly problematic in relation to private communication.  Automated checks of most intimate messages like nude pictures sent via public networks, for example,  can result in employees of international corporations and police authorities viewing these intimate images. In other words: strangers gain access to someone‚Äôs most personal messages and could in turn disseminate them. This creates a new risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass surveillance does not, as some argue, contribute to preventing terrorism or child sexual abuse. Sascha Lobo has argued in the German news magazine Der Spiegel that  more surveillance does not necessarily lead to more security : &amp;ldquo;Since 2014, a total of 24 identified perpetrators have carried out 13 Islamist murder attacks in the EU ‚Äì and all, yes literally 100 percent of the attackers were previously known to the authorities and had a propensity for violence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Effectiveness of mass surveillance in solving crimes has not been proven. However, three things are certain  to help in  effectively protecting children from sexual violence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted prosecution, instead of overburdening the authorities with harmless footage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevention and intervention work in families and institutions, regular public discussions with experts in the media, and mandatory training for all those who work with people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition of the fact that abuse mostly happens within the family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we conclude: We must not base the standards of our society on the behavior of criminals. Crimes cannot be prevented by making every citizen a potential suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We see a clear danger in the EU initiative &amp;ldquo;Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content&amp;rdquo; that secure communication for citizens and companies is to be abandoned on the grounds of child protection. This must not happen in an open, democratic society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As experts in the field of secure communication, we are available to discuss with the EU Commission on what is technically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter was written with the assistance of Tanja Bullert, community worker specializing in the prevention of and intervention in sexualized violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signatory:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2021</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Development on Cryptomator 1.5.x is coming to an end and we are now working on the next major version 1.6.x. Read more about it in this roadmap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-desktop-app&#34;&gt;State of the Desktop App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update to version 1.6.0 is just around the corner! The release will mainly contain some invisible changes that will allow us to add new features in a timely manner. One of the main points here is to implement a new vault format (Vault Format 8). It makes the integration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/8&#34;&gt;other authentication methods&lt;/a&gt; in the future possible, for example to enable 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/projects/7&#34;&gt;integration of a sanitizer&lt;/a&gt;. Until now, a separate program was needed to check the state of your vault and to execute cleanup and restore commands. In the future, this will be possible directly in the Cryptomator user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is now a prototype for the distribution of Cryptomator as a Microsoft Software Installation (.msi), but the implementation still has alpha character. Furthermore, we have updated Cryptomator to JDK 16 with the latest &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.14&#34;&gt;version 1.5.14&lt;/a&gt;, which brings some upstream fixes. Unfortunately, we could not make any progress with regard to Flatpak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-android-app&#34;&gt;State of the Android App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed in our blog, we finally published the source code of the app! Apart from that, vault format 8 is also a big topic in our development here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the update to version 1.5.14 (currently still in a beta version), pCloud is natively supported by Cryptomator. Many thanks to Manu for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/android/pull/283&#34;&gt;his open source contribution&lt;/a&gt;! Another small change is that since the update 1.5.13, it is possible to sort the vault list and thus get a better overview of the vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not all we have planned for the Android app! We are happy to release Cryptomator on F-Droid soon. Also, we hope to be able to include more clouds soon and enable access to content of the vault via third-party apps with a &amp;ldquo;document provider&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-ios-app&#34;&gt;State of the iOS App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of vault format 8, the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; iOS app will probably get its last major update to version 1.6.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, work on the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; iOS app continues. As announced in the last roadmap, the iOS app will be fully integrated into the Files app. We are already very far along. Nevertheless, we still have some work to do, as we want to offer some features like dark mode or support for multiple accounts from the same cloud provider right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t promise you an exact release date yet, but we hope we will release a first beta version via TestFlight in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>World Backup Day: How to Be on the Safe Side</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Basically, there are two types of people: Those who back up regularly and those who have never lost data. On the occasion of &amp;ldquo;World Backup Day&amp;rdquo;, we want to explain to you why you should think about creating a backup regularly, even if you have been lucky so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-a-backup-actually-do&#34;&gt;What does a backup actually do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a backup is a copy of your data. This can be your smartphone, your laptop, your hard drive, family photos, etc. If your device stops working for any reason, your data is not lost if you have created a backup. Therefore, it is recommended to back up your data at regular intervals to prevent major losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-create-a-backup&#34;&gt;How do I create a backup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that your data is stored in an external location. Many still associate a backup with an external data carrier, such as a hard drive. However, this is inferior to the modern cloud variant in two elementary points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, every device has a certain percentage probability of failure. In the case of a hard drive, for example, this &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure#Metrics_of_failures&#34;&gt;failure probability&lt;/a&gt; can be between 1.7% (in the first year) and 8.6% (in the third year), not including possible external circumstances such as fire or water damage. Of course, you can also create a backup on several hard drives, the more you use, the lower the probability of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another risk factor with external hard drives is the lack of geographic redundancy, in short, location independence. In other words, if your house catches fire, both your computer and the backup on the hard drive are gone. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s a rather drastic way of putting it, but that is the basic concept. You can achieve geographical redundancy by storing the data on the servers of cloud providers; it is not uncommon for them to be geographically distributed all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of the failure probability is minimized by arranging the hard drives &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures#MTBF_and_MDT_for_networks_of_components&#34;&gt;in parallel&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this means that several functionally identical, redundant copies of the backup exist at the same time, but only one of these needs to function in order to make the backup data available. You can think of this as mirroring data, with each mirroring the risk of data loss decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-protect-my-backup-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;How do I protect my backup in the cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, your data is protected in the cloud behind an account. However, they are of course still stored on servers and are therefore never 100% secure from unauthorized access. With the help of cloud encryption, you can take the security of your data into your own hands. With Cryptomator, you can create a kind of &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; vault that can only be accessed by those who have the correct password to open the vault. This way, attackers can theoretically still access the cloud, but cannot do anything with the encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download Cryptomator free of charge &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/downloads/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source: Cryptomator for Android</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We announced it last month and now we are ready‚Ä¶ our gift to the community for the holidays: Cryptomator for Android is now fully open-source! Check out the repository here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/android&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptomator/android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;inline-block rounded&#34; src=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/android-open-source.png&#34; srcset=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/android-open-source.png 1x, https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/android-open-source@2x.png 2x&#34; alt=&#34;Cryptomator for Android is now open-source&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will definitely be a transition phase and learning curve for us to fine-tune the repository and coordinate open-source contributions but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too far off the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; repository Cryptomator for Windows, macOS, and Linux, which was open-source from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to your contributions and are very grateful to you and the whole community that made this step possible. To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/donate/&#34;&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/&#34;&gt;sponsoring&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about Cryptomator for iOS? To quote from our &amp;ldquo;Roadmap Late 2020&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t open-source the current app anymore because we&amp;rsquo;d like to look forward. The new app is written with open-sourcing it in mind but it will still take some time until we can release anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays and a happy new year! üéÅ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator Roadmap Late 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently released Cryptomator 1.5.10 for Windows, macOS, and Linux with many new features and bugfixes. Well, actually the changes were in 1.5.9 but we followed it up with a hotfix release. üòÅ With the (crazy) year nearing its end, we&amp;rsquo;d like to give you some insight to our roadmap across all platforms for the upcoming months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-desktop-app&#34;&gt;State of the Desktop App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the redesign and full rewrite of the UI in 1.5.0, we established a good foundation for adding further features. There was one former feature that didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut though, which is now back with the latest version: Vault Statistics. üéâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;inline-block rounded&#34; src=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/vault-statistics.png&#34; srcset=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/vault-statistics.png 1x, https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/vault-statistics@2x.png 2x&#34; alt=&#34;Vault Statistics in Cryptomator&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there! Vault passwords can now also be stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet&#34;&gt;KWallet&lt;/a&gt; on Linux. Huge thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) for his contribution! And last but not least, it is now possible to mount the vault via FUSE on Windows. This is still a beta feature! In order to try it, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/&#34;&gt;WinFSP&lt;/a&gt; needs to be installed. We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your feedback on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the distribution front, we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite meet our expectations. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with Flatpak as we just can&amp;rsquo;t convince its sandbox to properly support FUSE drives. But we&amp;rsquo;re not giving up on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the UI, we introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/integrations-api&#34;&gt;integrations-api&lt;/a&gt; alongside implementations for each OS. It&amp;rsquo;s a new way for Cryptomator to include native (also OS-specific) functionalities. Now easier than ever, you can implement native functions. So grab your keyboard and start hacking! üòÅ With this change, we archived the old &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/native-functions&#34;&gt;native-functions&lt;/a&gt; repository. üëã&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next? Our plan is to move on to 1.6.x. First of all, we want to integrate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer&#34;&gt;Sanitizer&lt;/a&gt;, so you can check your vault health and run cleanup and recovery tasks right within the Cryptomator UI. Furthermore, by decoupling the key derivation from the vault encryption, we plan to give you more options for authentication, including third-party password storage, 2FA, and multi-user access using individual passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-android-app&#34;&gt;State of the Android App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last months, we added new features like &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/biometric-authentication-e-g-face-unlock-coming-soon/6089&#34;&gt;face unlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/sort-directory-listings/5958&#34;&gt;sort directory listings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/search-in-current-folder-using-glob-pattern-matching/5928&#34;&gt;search using glob pattern matching&lt;/a&gt;. Some community members also translated the app to &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/translated-into-french/5962&#34;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/cryptomator-is-soon-available-in-turkish/6560&#34;&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks for their contributions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we have some exciting news about our Android app! The project is in the perfect situation to fulfill the two biggest wishes of the community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source: Publishing the source code of the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document Provider: Accessing the content of the vault using third-party apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You heard that right, we are going to open-source Cryptomator for Android! The fact that the app is open-core had its legitimate reasons but we are now fully confident that we can open-source the app without compromises. We are working hard to publish the complete source code within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the highly anticipated Document Provider feature will be on our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-ios-app&#34;&gt;State of the iOS App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up with Cryptomator for iOS? For the last 6-7 months, we have been hard at work on a &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; new app written in Swift. Our first efforts can already be seen in our new open-source libraries for Swift: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib-swift&#34;&gt;cryptolib-swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cloud-access-swift&#34;&gt;cloud-access-swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be so special about the rewrite? Cryptomator will be fully integrated into the Files app. This comes with many benefits like thumbnails, support for third-party apps that can edit files directly inside the vault, and many more! But that also means, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a &amp;ldquo;custom&amp;rdquo; file browser inside the app anymore. Integration into the Files app is one of the most requested features of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about open source? We won&amp;rsquo;t open-source the current app anymore because we&amp;rsquo;d like to look forward. The new app is written with open-sourcing it in mind but it will still take some time until we can release anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll definitely do extensive testing via TestFlight in the next year. Stay tuned for that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator for Android for Us Paranoids</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is aimed towards the paranoid Cryptomator power users among us and describes how to fully establish a relationship of trust with Cryptomator for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to our desktop application, we claim that you should in fact &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trust us but you (or at least many developers) can instead &lt;em&gt;inspect&lt;/em&gt; what Cryptomator is doing. For our mobile apps, this is only half the truth, frankly. While the encryption code is fully open-source, the UI and cloud access code isn&amp;rsquo;t (yet üòâ).&lt;br&gt;
If you count yourself as one of the more paranoid users, who prefer to compile everything yourselves, you might ask the legitimate question: How can you check the current, open-core app for backdoors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backdoor usually requires communication with an external server. If vaults are only opened from the device&amp;rsquo;s file system, the Cryptomator app does not require an internet connection. Alternatively, the vault can be synchronized bidirectionally to the file system of the smartphone with a third-party application such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://syncthing.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this setup, the Cryptomator app can have its internet access revoked using the Android operating system features, which prevents the app from sending or receiving any data to or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;inline-block rounded&#34; src=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/android-for-paranoids-permission.png&#34; alt=&#34;Android revoke Cryptomator&#39;s internet permission&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, even if there ever was a backdoor in Cryptomator for Android, it would not be possible for the intercepted data to leave the smartphone. This is ensured by the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator 1.5.0 Release</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;inline-block rounded&#34; src=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png&#34; srcset=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png 1x, https://cryptomator.org/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0@2x.png 2x&#34; alt=&#34;Cryptomator 1.5.0 is now available with a brand-new user interface (incl. dark mode) and an improved vault format&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&amp;rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/donate/&#34;&gt;buying a donation key&lt;/a&gt;, which unlocks the new dark mode. ‚ù§Ô∏è &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the desktop app are available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. ‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cryptomator-for-ios--android&#34;&gt;Cryptomator for iOS &amp;amp; Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well. To celebrate the release, our mobile apps are 40% off until April 23! ü§ñ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptomator for Android is now also available as an APK version &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptomator.org/android/&#34;&gt;through our own online store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&amp;rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&amp;rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-our-desktop-application&#34;&gt;State of our Desktop Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have already discussed &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter&#34;&gt;upcoming changes&lt;/a&gt; to what we call the &lt;em&gt;vault format&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not simply &lt;em&gt;redesign&lt;/em&gt; our UI, we did a full &lt;em&gt;rewrite&lt;/em&gt; of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&amp;rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&amp;rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-android-app&#34;&gt;State of the Android App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn‚Äôt work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, we&amp;rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-the-ios-app&#34;&gt;State of the iOS App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150&#34;&gt;What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), we&amp;rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, we&amp;rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter&#34;&gt;new translations&lt;/a&gt; added by our great community on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-up-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&amp;rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched &lt;code&gt;.deb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.rpm&lt;/code&gt; files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729&#34;&gt;we didn&amp;rsquo;t get Cryptomator working&lt;/a&gt; due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&amp;rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.&lt;/p&gt;
