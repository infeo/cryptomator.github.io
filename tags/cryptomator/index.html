          <h2>Cryptomator for Android for Us Paranoids</h2>
          <p>This blog post is aimed towards the paranoid Cryptomator power users among us and describes how to fully establish a relationship of trust with Cryptomator for Android.</p>
<p>When it comes to our desktop application, we claim that you should in fact <em>not</em> trust us but you (or at least many developers) can instead <em>inspect</em> what Cryptomator is doing. For our mobile apps, this is only half the truth, frankly. While the encryption code is fully open-source, the UI and cloud access code isn&rsquo;t (yet üòâ).<br>
If you count yourself as one of the more paranoid users, who prefer to compile everything yourselves, you might ask the legitimate question: How can you check the current, open-core app for backdoors?</p>
<p>A backdoor usually requires communication with an external server. If vaults are only opened from the device&rsquo;s file system, the Cryptomator app does not require an internet connection. Alternatively, the vault can be synchronized bidirectionally to the file system of the smartphone with a third-party application such as <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syncthing</a>.</p>
<p>Using this setup, the Cryptomator app can have its internet access revoked using the Android operating system features, which prevents the app from sending or receiving any data to or from the internet.</p>
<figure class="text-center">
  <img class="inline-block rounded" src="/img/blog/android-for-paranoids-permission.png" alt="Android revoke Cryptomator's internet permission" />
</figure>
<p>Thus, even if there ever was a backdoor in Cryptomator for Android, it would not be possible for the intercepted data to leave the smartphone. This is ensured by the operating system.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator 1.5.0 Release</h2>
          <figure class="text-center">
  <img class="inline-block rounded" src="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png" srcset="/img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0.png 1x, /img/blog/cryptomator-1-5-0@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptomator 1.5.0 is now available with a brand-new user interface (incl. dark mode) and an improved vault format" />
</figure>
<p>Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.</p>
<p>To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider <a href="/donate/">buying a donation key</a>, which unlocks the new dark mode. ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detailed release notes</a> for the desktop app are available on GitHub.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, this website is also shining in a completely new design. ‚ú®</p>
<h2 id="cryptomator-for-ios--android">Cryptomator for iOS &amp; Android</h2>
<p>New updates for iOS and Android have been released as well. To celebrate the release, our mobile apps are 40% off until April 23! ü§ñ</p>
<p>Cryptomator for Android is now also available as an APK version <a href="/android/">through our own online store</a>.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2020</h2>
          <p>Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-our-desktop-application">State of our Desktop Application</h2>
<p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p>
<p>While we have already discussed <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes</a> to what we call the <em>vault format</em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:</p>
<p>We did not simply <em>redesign</em> our UI, we did a full <em>rewrite</em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.</p>
<p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-android-app">State of the Android App</h2>
<p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.</li>
<li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn‚Äôt work</li>
<li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background</li>
<li>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-of-the-ios-app">State of the iOS App</h2>
<p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. üòâ</p>
<h2 id="what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150">What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?</h2>
<p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986">this one</a>), we&rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations</a> added by our great community on a regular basis.</p>
<h2 id="whats-up-next">What&rsquo;s up next?</h2>
<p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.</p>
<p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729">we didn&rsquo;t get Cryptomator working</a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.</p>
<p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</h2>
          <p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.</p>
<h2 id="desktop">Desktop</h2>
<p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&rdquo; feature.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save password in system (Linux):</strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. üòÑ The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!</li>
<li><strong>Custom Mount Flags:</strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: <em>Use at your own risk!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. üòâ</p>
<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>
<p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.</p>
<p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Provider</a> which is going to be extended by the methods &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Move&rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.</p>
<h2 id="android">Android</h2>
<p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic photo upload:</strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.</li>
<li><strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:</strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are considering these features for future versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LRU Cache:</strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Google Team Drives:</strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:</strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.</li>
<li><strong>Unlocking with system password:</strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)</li>
<li><strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:</strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Upload of directories (recursive):</strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.</li>
</ul>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2019</h2>
          <p>Hey it&rsquo;s a new year, so here comes our <del>quarterly</del> annual üôà roadmap preview.</p>
<h3 id="openjdk-and-openjfx">OpenJDK and OpenJFX</h3>
<p>Until now we&rsquo;ve been using Oracle JDK, since this included the GUI library we used for Cryptomator: JavaFX. Beginning with JDK 11, we plan to switch to OpenJDK and OpenJFX. JavaFX will no longer be included in the Oracle JDK anyway and OpenJFX promises shorter release cycles and - as the name suggests - is developed in an open process.</p>
<p>Since we no longer depend on non-free software, Cryptomator could theoretically move from &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; to &ldquo;main&rdquo; in Debian repos.</p>
<p>We also hope that building Cryptomator becomes easier, since OpenJFX is a normal dependency and you no longer need to install the Oracle JDK.</p>
<h3 id="symlinks">Symlinks</h3>
<p>We have successfully moved to FUSE (Linux and macOS) and Dokany (Windows). Now it is time to improve the file systems. One of the most asked features is support for symbolic links. If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, don&rsquo;t worry. For everyone else: Stay tuned for a 1.4.x update introducing symlinks.</p>
<h3 id="ui-redesign">UI Redesign</h3>
<p>We plan to redesign the whole user interface from scratch with Cryptomator 1.5.0. In order to do this, we are happy to get your input. If you have any ideas on how Cryptomator should look, feel free to join the discussion in our <a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/ui-redesign-thread/2850">redesign thread</a>.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2018</h2>
          <p>Since it is understandable that not all of our users can track all development activities on GitHub, I would like to write a few paragraphs here about the technical updates that are planned for Cryptomator in 2018 and their impact on usage.</p>
<h3 id="fuse">FUSE</h3>
<p>The biggest upcoming change is the implementation of FUSE-based drives. This will be <em>additional</em> to WebDAV and will become the new default setting. We are currently developing the <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary library</a>. It is based on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jnr-fuse</a>, which means you need <em>FUSE for macOS</em> or <em>WinFsp</em> in case of Windows. The Linux kernel supports FUSE out of the box.</p>
<p>A big challenge at the moment is how to include <em>WinFsp</em> or <em>FUSE for macOS</em> in the installer. First test versions will therefore require manual installation of named libraries.</p>
<p>The benefit of using FUSE lies not only in performance enhancements (which are already clearly measurable in the current state of development for some file/directory operations) but also in the expected increase in compatibility with third-party software. There are several problems related to the WebDAV drive, as can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues?q=is%3Aopen&#43;is%3Aissue&#43;label%3Amisc%3Awebdav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our issues list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="java-9">Java 9</h3>
<p>During the Christmas holidays, I made all libraries and the desktop application compatible with Java 9. Our <a href="https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI builds</a> now run uniformly with JDK 9 in containers. However, the code is still compiled for older Java versions, not just because our Android app depends on it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point? Java 9 is a huge step in the development of the Java platform. In addition to various bug fixes that directly benefit Cryptomator users, e.g. better support for HiDPI displays under Windows and Linux, there were massive refactorings which form the basis for a new release model of the Java platform with new <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature releases in six-month cycles</a>. This means that we will be able to benefit from new features in the future more rapidly without having to rely on unstable test versions.</p>
<p>However, the conversion to Java 9 with Cryptomator 1.4.0 is also the basis for the use of the Java Platform Module System from Cryptomator 1.5.0 onwards, whereby <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much smaller applications</a> can be built. In a first test, the size of the Cryptomator application for macOS was reduced from over 200 MiB (in the installed state) to about 70 MiB.</p>
<h3 id="intellij">IntelliJ</h3>
<p>We switched our build platform from Eclipse to IntelliJ because the JDK 9 compatible versions of Eclipse contain changes to the compiler that didn&rsquo;t get along with code generated by <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dagger</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our Android developers are already used to IntelliJ so that we can harmonize our tools a little bit here.</p>
<h3 id="64-bit">64 Bit</h3>
<p>Since both WinFsp and JDK 9 require 64 bit, Cryptomator will no longer support 32 bit systems as of version 1.4.0. Although this is a pity, it also speeds up the development process because fewer systems have to be tested.</p>
<p>Cryptomator 1.3.x will be 100% compatible with 1.4.0. This means that users who depend on 32-bit software can continue to use Cryptomator vaults.</p>

<li>New log system with log file rotation and exposed, user-adjustable configuration</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount <code>cryptomator-vault</code> which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code> (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved macOS Sierra integration, unlocking doesn&rsquo;t ask for username/password for <code>localhost</code> anymore (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#170</a>)</li>
<li>Improved iCloud Drive compatibility (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#364</a>)</li>

<li>Dropped SHA-1 signatures in Windows Authenticode code signing</li>
<li>Dropped official Windows Vista support</li>
<li>Dropped official Ubuntu Vivid and Wily support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-details-on-windows-mounting">Technical Details on Windows Mounting</h3>
<p>After we have fixed <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#431</a>, we noticed various issues on Windows. We tried hosting the virtual drive via <code>localhost</code>, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>::1</code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529</a>), and sometimes Office didn&rsquo;t properly work (<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512</a>). That&rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host <code>cryptomator-vault</code> (which is mapped to <code>127.0.0.1</code>) into the <code>hosts</code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don&rsquo;t quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!</p>
<h3 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-The-Hood Improvements</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!</p>

          <h2>Mysterious Windows Bug Fix with 1.2.3 Update</h2>
          <p>Cryptomator 1.2.3 for Windows fixes a mysterious bug, commonly known as system error 53 or 67. Well, it&rsquo;s not that mysterious anymore, but this particular error had been haunting us from the beginning! Cycor on GitHub (almost casually) pointed out in <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/210#issuecomment-262034669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Issue 210</a> that he found the cause of system error 53/67 after a few months of experiencing the issue himself.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is a Windows Registry entry responsible for listing available network providers called <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959369.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProviderOrder</a>. Cryptomator&rsquo;s virtual drive is based on WebDAV. Therefore, a missing <code>webclient</code> value in the <code>ProviderOrder</code> registry key would lead to such error. We were stunned, desperate, and hopeless for many months, because we were never able to reproduce the issue. We added things like the IPv6 literal option (which is probably going to be removed in a future version) or thought that some firewall was responsible for the error. But nope! Clearly some applications modify this registry entry, because a clean Windows installation doesn&rsquo;t have the <code>webclient</code> value missing. Shame on them! üîî</p>
<p>We fixed this issue by patching the Cryptomator for Windows installer and added some code that adds the <code>webclient</code> value back to the <code>ProviderOrder</code> key, if it is missing. The registry key can be found at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order</code>. If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer and stumbled on this blog post while having the same issue and even using Inno Setup yourself, you can <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/blob/master/package/windows/Cryptomator.iss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Cycor for finding the solution to this weird bug! üòÑ</p>
<p>Furthermore, version 1.2.3 (also available for Mac and Linux) includes other improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saved password can now be forgotten by deselecting the checkbox. [Windows/Mac]</li>
<li>WebDAV server keeps running after unlocking a vault even if mounting fails.</li>
<li>Log files don&rsquo;t contain debug-level information per default anymore, added debug mode in settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoFS</a> in version 1.0.0, which is now ready to be integrated in our main application Cryptomator. The next minor release Cryptomator 1.3 will mainly include a &ldquo;heart transplant&rdquo; with the integration of CryptoFS. This is a requirement before we can integrate FUSE/Dokany, which is currently scheduled for version 1.4.</p>

          <h2>Cryptomator for Android 0.1 Beta</h2>
          <p>We&rsquo;ve finally released the first beta version of Cryptomator for Android after almost 6 months of development. It&rsquo;s a completely new and native app. In this process, we outsourced the cryptographic code from our main project, which is now available as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoLib</a>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to test the beta version. Follow <a href="/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> for more information. Version 0.1 is by far not feature-complete and has known issues, but we&rsquo;re of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>
<p>You can send us feedback on <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. We&rsquo;ve created a repository just for collecting Android issues. Please review and follow our <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your patience! We know some of you have been already waiting for an Android app of Cryptomator for many months. We&rsquo;re looking forward to your feedback! üòÑ</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 0.2: We&rsquo;re going to fix some critical/major bugs first, don&rsquo;t expect too many new features.</li>
<li>After that we&rsquo;ll most likely successively add support for Google Drive, OneDrive, and WebDAV.</li>
<li>Our goal is to add the functionality equal to the iOS app for the final version.</li>

          <h2>Cryptomator 1.2.0 Release</h2>
          <p>Cryptomator 1.2.0 for Windows, Mac, and Linux is out now!</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Windows and Mac you can now optionally save your password. This is a preparation for auto-unlock (GitHub Issue <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40</a>), one of the most wanted features we&rsquo;re planning for the next minor release. Linux support will follow, as soon as we figured out a standard way to protect saved credentials across most distributions.</li>
<li>New migration screen preventing accidental migration.</li>
<li>Cryptomator for Mac will now appear in Dock + Application Switcher, when not minimized to the menu bar icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes-and-improvements">Fixes and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved speed of directory listing by using a deterministic cleartext size calculation.</li>
<li>A full list of fixed issues can be found <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/22?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-downside">The Downside</h3>
<p>Sadly, we had to drop file size obfuscation support. From this version onwards, there is a bijective function for calculating the cleartext size from the ciphertext size and vice versa.</p>
<p>We always strive to offer the best of both, security and usability. But sometimes we need to find a compromise in order to implement all the features, we&rsquo;re planning for future releases. In the past, we needed to access the first few bytes of a file in order to determine the cleartext file size, which led to <code>O(n)</code> I/O activities with <code>n</code> being the number of files per directories. In this case, we decided in favor of <code>O(1)</code> directory listings, which is especially useful for large directory listings, file size determination via mobile devices, or slow internet connections.</p>
<p>File size obfuscation has never been a cryptographically effective protection against adversaries getting to know the approximate cleartext size. Anything the size of a movie remained the size of a movie and was most likely not mistaken for a text document. Nevertheless, we will miss you. R.I.P.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cryptomator-120-for-ios">Cryptomator 1.2.0 for iOS</h2>

          <h2>Security Fixes with 1.1.4 Update</h2>
          <p>Cryptomator 1.1.4 for Windows, OS X, and Linux fixes two (related) vulnerabilities allowing malicious Flash files being injected into vaults, that can be executed to &ldquo;bypass&rdquo; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOP</a> and access files from a Flash-enabled browser (GitHub¬†Issues¬†<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">318</a>¬†&amp;¬†<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">319</a>).¬†Kudos to Lukas Reschke for reporting them!</p>
<p>Various bugs with Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows drive letters, the Windows Registry and WebDAV access on Linux were also fixed. A complete list of closed issues is available <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/20?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re making progress with the Android app. If everything goes as planned, you can expect a first beta release next month. We&rsquo;ll send out invitation links to those who¬†have <a href="/#newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed interest in participating in the beta</a>. Stay tuned!</li>
<li>We plan to improve the desktop app compatibility- and performance-wise by integrating <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUSE</a>/<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dokany</a>¬†(<a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFM has been suggested</a> instead of Dokany, we&rsquo;re still evaluating this). Hopefully, we can launch a first beta with these major changes by the end of this year.</li>
<li>Due to these major development efforts¬†we have been modularizing the cryptographic relevant libraries into <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptolib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptofs</a> under the GPL license. In that way, it&rsquo;s easier for us to use the same libraries across multiple apps and also for third parties¬†to use them independent of our main application. These libraries aren&rsquo;t final yet.</li>
<li>We haven&rsquo;t planned our 1.2 milestone yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>¬†has been highly requested and is probably the biggest contender right now. We hear you and we&rsquo;d like to thank you for all your feedback! üòÑ</li>

          <h2>In-Depth: Export Compliance for French iOS App Store</h2>
          <p>Cyptomator for iOS has finally been approved by the French administration. You can download it now in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/cryptomator/id953086535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French App Store</a>. We&rsquo;d like to share our experience on how to receive export compliance for the French iOS App Store.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, you also need the U.S. Encryption Registration (ERN) approval from the U.S. Bureau of Industry (BIS). But this has already been covered by many sites, just google for <code>export compliance ern ios app store</code>.</p>
<p>However, there is little information on how to get the French encryption declaration approval from the Agence nationale de la s√©curit√© des syst√®mes d&rsquo;information (ANSSI). This information could be useful for fellow developers that are e.g. using third-party libraries for cryptographic operations in their iOS app. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is also needed for the Google Play Store (or other Android app stores). We&rsquo;ll see soon enough.</p>
<h3 id="when-do-you-need-french-approval">When do you need French approval?</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look on how we&rsquo;ve filled out our export compliance documentation in iTunes Connect, which is needed for apps containing encryption.</p>
<table class="table-auto">
  <tr class="border-t">
    <th class="px-4 py-2">ID</th>
    <th class="px-4 py-2">Question</th>
    <th class="px-4 py-2">Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="border-t">
    <td class="px-4 py-2">1</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Is your app designed to use cryptography or does it contain or incorporate cryptography? (Select Yes even if your app is only utilizing the encryption available in iOS or OS X.)</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="border-t">
    <td class="px-4 py-2">2</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app qualify for any of the exemptions provided in Category 5, Part 2 of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations?</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="border-t">
    <td class="px-4 py-2">3</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms that are proprietary or yet to be accepted as standard by international standard bodies (such as, the IEEE, IETF, ITU, and so on)?</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="border-t">
    <td class="px-4 py-2">4</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms instead of, or in addition to, accessing or using the encryption in iOS and OS X?</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="border-t">
    <td class="px-4 py-2">5</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Is your app going to be available on the French App Store?</td>
    <td class="px-4 py-2">Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Our answer to question 4 is probably less common among typical apps using encryption. Additionally to Apple&rsquo;s CommonCrypto, we&rsquo;re making use of OpenSSL and scrypt, which aren&rsquo;t bundled with the standard library of iOS. Only then you&rsquo;re going to be asked question 5 and only then you have to submit a copy of the French encryption declaration approval from the ANSSI.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-an-application-to-the-anssi">How do I submit an application to the ANSSI?</h3>
<p>Thought you&rsquo;d never ask. Thankfully, there is an English website for this: <a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/</a></p>
<p>But the fun stops there. From now on, everything is in French. Yup. That&rsquo;s right. Everything. Even the responses you receive are in French. And you have to submit your request via mail (yes, not email).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s our advice on this? Best case you know someone who can read/write French, but in our case we just used Google Translate extensively. We&rsquo;ve filled out the approval form in English, because we hoped for common sense that they&rsquo;re at least able to read our request in English. And it worked!</p>
<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-until-my-request-has-been-processedapproved">How long does it take until my request has been processed/approved?</h3>
<p>The official statement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Declaration requests are processed within one month from receipt of the complete request file and authorisation requests within four months from the same date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve submitted our declaration request in the beginning of April 2016 and received a first response in the beginning of May. It was just to inform us that they&rsquo;ve received our request and it&rsquo;ll take another two months to finish the process. In the end, we&rsquo;ve received the approval two months after our submission.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how long it took to get the ERN approval, but it was just a matter of days and completely processed online.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I hope you learned something from our experience and if you&rsquo;re an app developer struggling with the same issue, you hopefully received some insight in this process. Obviously, this information may change in the future, so do some additional research. üòâ</p>
<p>Funny story: In the approval form are checkboxes, which you can enable if you&rsquo;re sending a CD or USB flash drive with information of your product (like commercial brochure, user manual, technical details). I couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were asking for, so I didn&rsquo;t send anything besides the approval form. They kindly sent me an email, if I could provide a commercial or technical brochure for Cryptomator so that they can process my request. So I did that via email and everything was fine. üòÑ</p>

<h3 id="whats-new">What&rsquo;s New:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Password Strength Indicator: Based on Dropbox&rsquo;s <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zxcvbn</a>. Kudos to Jean-No√´l Charon (jncharon on GitHub) for implementing this feature.</li>
<li>Sync Conflict Resolution: When editing a file on multiple devices simultaneously, version conflicts are inevitable. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. can detect these conflicts and will provide all versions of the affected file. From now on Cryptomator will transparently pass detected conflicts right to the decrypted drive to ensure no version gets lost.</li>
<li>Several small tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also released Cryptomator 1.1 for iOS recently. WebDAV support is finally here! Encrypt your files in cloud storage services like ownCloud, HiDrive, MagentaCLOUD, STACK, blaucloud, and many more.</p>
