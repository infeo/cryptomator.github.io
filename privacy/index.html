<p>In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations which are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>

<h3 id="81-right-to-information---art-15-gdpr">8.1 Right to information - Art. 15 GDPR</h3>
<p>The right of access gives the data subject a full insight into the data concerning him or her and some other important criteria, such as the purposes of processing or the duration of storage. The exceptions to this right regulated in § 34 German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) apply.</p>

The exceptions to this right regulated in § 35 BDSG apply.</p>
<h3 id="84-right-to-restriction-of-processing---art-18-gdpr">8.4 Right to Restriction of Processing - Art. 18 GDPR</h3>
