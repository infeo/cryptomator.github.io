          <p class="mb-0">Between all the work on Cryptomator, we need to remind ourselves to not forget about our regular updates post. While most of you have already noticed that we&rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.
State of our Desktop Application We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.
Desktop In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Hey it&rsquo;s a new year, so here comes our quarterly annual 🙈 roadmap preview.
OpenJDK and OpenJFX Until now we&rsquo;ve been using Oracle JDK, since this included the GUI library we used for Cryptomator: JavaFX. Beginning with JDK 11, we plan to switch to OpenJDK and OpenJFX. JavaFX will no longer be included in the Oracle JDK anyway and OpenJFX promises shorter release cycles and - as the name suggests - is developed in an open process.</p>

FUSE The biggest upcoming change is the implementation of FUSE-based drives. This will be additional to WebDAV and will become the new default setting. We are currently developing the necessary library.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Another day, another data breach. Two weeks ago, the headline news in Australia was that some 50,000 workers had their personal records exposed. And just as every summer now inevitably becomes the hottest on record, every data breach is always the largest in history. This is certainly the case here – such a scale of data loss is unprecedented in Australia, if not elsewhere.
The breach is also typical in another way: it was caused by human error.</p>

We have worked extensively during the last year to ensure the app&rsquo;s security and usability. Thanks to your feedback and the experiences of more than 10,000 beta testers, the Android app has finally reached the level of maturity that fulfills Cryptomator&rsquo;s high standards.</p>

Improvements  Auto-Unlock!!! 🎉 (#40) We finally implemented the most-wished feature. Still experimental and will be completed by autostart (optionally hidden) in future versions New vault format 6 (#521) Added new options to &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; screen: Mount/unmount without locking/unlocking (#452) Network access now filtered by the socket instead of the application (#431) You can now change the socket port without restarting Cryptomator New log system with log file rotation and exposed, user-adjustable configuration  Windows  Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount cryptomator-vault which is mapped to 127.</p>

  Cyberduck allows access to your cloud storage without an additional sync client. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure &amp; OneDrive, and OpenStack Swift are some of the supported protocols.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Cryptomator 1.2.3 for Windows fixes a mysterious bug, commonly known as system error 53 or 67. Well, it&rsquo;s not that mysterious anymore, but this particular error had been haunting us from the beginning! Cycor on GitHub (almost casually) pointed out in GitHub Issue 210 that he found the cause of system error 53/67 after a few months of experiencing the issue himself.
Apparently, there is a Windows Registry entry responsible for listing available network providers called ProviderOrder.</p>

You&rsquo;re welcome to test the beta version. Follow this link for more information. Version 0.1 is by far not feature-complete and has known issues, but we&rsquo;re of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>
